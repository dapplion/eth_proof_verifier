//! The SP1 backend against a real proof.
//!
//! The fixture is a genuine SP1 compressed proof, its program's verifying key, and the public
//! values its guest committed to, taken from `eth-act/ere`'s `ere-verifier-sp1` test fixtures
//! (dual licensed Apache-2.0 OR MIT, the same as this crate). Its guest is one of ere's own test
//! programs rather than a stateless validator, so its public values are not a validation result —
//! which is beside the point here. What it proves is that this crate's vendored verifying-key
//! decoding, proof decoding, exit-code check and recursion verification accept a real proof and
//! return exactly the bytes its guest committed to.
